# Frontend-gallery

This is a ionic frontend application used for [mediaresource](../mediaresource)-style backends.

You need to download and install npm and run the following commands in this project's directory

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic cordova
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```

It automatically (ionic.conf.json) proxies backend-requests to a running mediaresource-Server.
